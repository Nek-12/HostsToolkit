This is my test repository to learn github and C++ Don't take it seriously.  
This console program uses hashing to remove duplicates in a text file. I tried to achieve maximum performance I could with my level of knowledge. I have only tested it with hosts files which it is most useful for.   
It automatically removes duplicated lines while preserving line order.  
## Usage:
You can drag'n'drop the file you wish to deduplicate onto the ADL.exe
