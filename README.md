# RDL
This is my test repository to learn github and C++ Don't take it seriously.  
This console program uses STL algorithms. I tried to achieve maximum performance I could with my level of knowledge. I have only tested it with hosts files which it is most useful for.
It supports non-ASCII characters 
It automatically **removes duplicated lines** and **sorts the file**
## Usage:
You can drag'n'drop the file you wish to deduplicate onto the ADL.exe
